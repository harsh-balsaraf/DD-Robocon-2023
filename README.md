# DD-Robocon-2023
In the theme of ABU Robocon 2023 which is being hosted by Cambodia . There were two robots Named Elephant Robot (ER) and Rabbit Robot (RR).The Tasks of both the robots includes picking up the stacks of rings and throwing them onto the poles of different dimensions inspired by the tradition of casting flowers over angkor wat.

In this team my role was as a head of Mechanical Team. As a head I get to be a lead in Designing both the Robots. It was challenging as well as a new Learning Experience for me as i get to learn the skills of CAD Designing, Fabrication and testing of the mechanisms that were implimented in the final versions of both the robots that were showcased at DD Robocon 2023 held at Thyagraj Stadium ,New Delhi.

In this Competition we achieved AIR Rank 2 in terms of points scored during the competition and Won Visvesvarya Award for "The Best Design" at DD Robocon 2023.
